## Installation

Simply initialize node and install the inquirer 8.2.4 package, then execute the code in your terminal, you will then be prompted for the design shape, color and text of your svg file, and once every question is answered, will generate your file  titled logo.svg.

## Usage 

This can be used to create SVG logos quickly, taking very little time, as well as will be a good way to study the basics of node and object oriented programming that we have been learning lately in class.

## Tests

To run a test, run npm test in your terminal, there is a currently a test for each of the three shape extensions.
